# twitter-isp-bot

Using the twitter api and speedtest library to test internet speed and tweet at Optimum when my upload/download speed dips below a certain threshold. I run this every 5 minutes through the Windows Task Scheduler, reading my twitter tags from a text file and using my internet speeds for data.

Based on https://github.com/james-atkinson/speedcomplainer

For Windows Task Scheduler I made the settings to run when I was on the computer every 10 minutes.
